This in-progress map can be viewed <a href="https://geojoek.github.io/NECSC_Leaflet_Map/">here</a> on Github Pages.

*Please Note* that this is an in-progress web-development project, and the map may be buggy.  This map is also using only 5 datapoints as a proof-of-concept test. The final map will display and query a database of over 100 items.

An interactive webmap using Leaflet.js and a number of plugins (via
CDN) to display project footprints for the Northeast Climate Science
Center.

Data source is as ESRI Feature layer hosted on U-Mass’s ArcGIS Online
organization.

More details re: libraries, obstacles, etc… forthcoming.
